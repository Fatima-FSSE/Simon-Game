# Simon-Game

Simon is an electronic game that tests the memory skills of the player. The game was first introduced in 1978 and has since then become a popular toy for children and adults alike. This web based Simon-Game is writtern HTML, CSS and JQuery.

The game is named after its creator Ralph H. Baer's childhood friend, Simon, and the game consists of a circular board with four colored sections: red, blue, green, and yellow. Each section has a button that lights up and plays a tone when pressed.

The game starts with a pattern of lights and tones that play in a sequence. The player's goal is to repeat the same sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order. Each successful repetition of the pattern results in the addition of one more element to the sequence, making it progressively harder as the game goes on.

If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button, the game ends. However, if the player completes the sequence correctly, they advance to the next round with a longer sequence of lights and tones to repeat.

Overall, the Simon game is a fun way to test and improve your memory skills. It is also an excellent game for children as it helps them develop their cognitive abilities, focus, and concentration.
